* Project: [ASCENT 45](https://ascent.aero/partner-45/)

This is my first undergraduate research. I learned about how research is professionally conducted on college campus and skills associate with engineering research. My primary tasks for this project include:
1. Developed a robust set of recommendations for improved estimation processes for takeoff weight, reduced thrust takeoffs, and departure profiles within AEDT
2. Calculated aircraftsâ€™ velocity, thrust, and temperature based on the raw data of 200 types of planes 
3. Used AEDT 3C software to analyze departure procedures of aircrafts based on FAA standards
