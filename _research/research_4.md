NASA Sensing With Independent Micro-Swimmers (SWIM) projects aims to build miniature robots for space exploration, specifically focusing on missions that help find habitable planets. These robots will be designed to have swarm intelligence. For more informaton about the project: ["Swarm of Tiny Swimming Robots Could Look for Life on Distant Worlds"](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/swarm-of-tiny-swimming-robots-could-look-for-life-on-distant-worlds)

My contribution to this project:
* Simulating the swarm behaviors of underwater robots using Processing
* Developing code for continuously reading the environmentâ€™s pressure and temperature using Seeeduino-XIAO microcontroller and MS5803 Pressure Sensor
* Investigating in optical wireless communication of robots operating underwater
