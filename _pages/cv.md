Computational Modeling for Mid-Ocean Ridges
* Time: Fall 2021 ~ **Present**
* Lab: [Sim Lab](https://joycesim.github.io/) at Georgia Tech
* Supervisor: Professor [Joyce Sim](https://joycesim.github.io/)
* Research Tasks: 
  * Evaluating the evolution of the global ridge system by considering the processes of melt focusing beneath mid-ocean ridges using two phase flow models
  * Using [Terraferma](http://terraferma.github.io/) to make computational model of mid-ocean ridgeâ€™s mantle convection
  * Investigating in special melting patterns at mid-ocean ridges and comparing them with the seismic data using [VBR calculator](https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/)
* Award: 
  * President's Undergraduate Research Awards ([PURA](https://undergradresearch.gatech.edu/content/presidents-undergraduate-research-awards)) Recipient for Fall 2022 Semester

Seismic Monitoring for CO2 Carbon Capture Storage with Statistical Machine Learning Approach
* Time: Summer 2022 ~ **Present**
* Lab: Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modelling [SLIM](https://slim.gatech.edu/whatisslim) at Georgia Tech
* Supervisor: Professor [Felix Herrmann](https://slim.gatech.edu/people/felix-j-herrmann)
* Research Tasks: 
  * Building statistical neural network classifiers for [CO2 leakage detection](https://slim.gatech.edu/research/geological-carbon-storage)
  * Utilizing [Gen.jl](https://www.gen.dev/) to build a stochastic model of the evolution of the CO2 storage in time with the approach of sequential-bayesian inferencing
  * Training [Conditional Normalizing Flow](https://github.com/slimgroup/SLIMTutorials/blob/main/08_conditional_normalizing_flow.ipynb) network using the proxy model and seismic observation of the CO2 storage
