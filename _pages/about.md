<!-- About me
======== -->
Hi I am Ting-Ying Yu and people usually call me **Rosen**. I am currently an undergraduate student at **Georgia Tech** with a major in **Electrical Engineering** (planning to graduate in Spring 2023). With a passion learning Machine Learning and Solid Earth Science , I am also minoring in **Computer Science (Intelligence specialization)** and **Earth and Atmosphere Science (Geophysics specialization)**. 

You can find the details of research here: [Research](https://rosenyu304.github.io/research/)

I am currently working on 4 research projects with the topics of: 
* Monitoring CO2 Storage with sequential Bayesian inference
* NASA SWIM Robots Development
* Mid-Ocean Ridges Modeling
* Venus Coronae Modeling

<!-- Recently, I am seeking a part-time software engineering position starting in January 2023 (Spring 2023 semester). I have experience writing code in almost all commercially-used high-level programming languages (Python, Java, C/C++, ......) with knowledge of machine learning & training datasets with Pytorch/Julia, object-oriented programming and data structure & algorithm. Moreover, I also enjoy doing embedded programming for building robots or microcontroller control! -->

I am looking for a PhD position starting in Fall 2023. My research interests include machine learning, image classification, robotics, computational simulations, computer perceptions, and computational science. However, I would love to explore anything that uses computing to solve scientific problem, especially topics related to applied artifical intellegence, robotics, (geo)physics, space exploration, or planetary science!

Fun Facts
========
- I am originally from Taiwan (currently on F1-Visa), and have been studying/traveling in more than 5 countries (US, Switzerland, Israel, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan). <br>

- During my spare time, I spend most of my time running (indoor/cross country) and in-door rock climbing (lead climbing certified @ [Stone Summit](https://www.ssclimbing.com/)). <br>
