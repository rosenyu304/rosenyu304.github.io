About me
========
I am currently an undergraduate student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a major in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) (planning to graduate in Spring 2023). With a passion learning Machine Learning and Solid Earth Science , I am also minoring in [Computer Science (Intelligence specialization)](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/minor-computing-intelligence) and [Earth and Atmosphere Science (Geophysics specialization)](https://eas.gatech.edu/undergrad/geophysics-minor). 
I am currently working on 4 research projects with the topics of: 
* Mid-Ocean Ridges Modeling
* Seismic Monitoring CO2 Storage with Machine Learning Approach
* NASA SWIM Robots Development
* Venus Coronae Modeling

Recently, I am looking for a PhD position starting in Fall 2023. My research interests include computational simulations, machine learning, computer perspectives, robotics, and imaging. However, I would love to explore anything that uses computing to solve scientific problem, especially topics related to artifical intellegence, robotics, space exploration, or planetary science!

Fun Facts
========
During my spare time, I spend most of my time running (indoor/cross country) and in-door rock climbing (lead climbing certified @ [Stone Summit](https://www.ssclimbing.com/)).
