<!-- About me
======== -->
Hi, I am Rosen. I am a graduate student at MIT DeCoDE lab majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Science & Engineering. 

<!-- With a passion learning Machine Learning and Solid Earth Science , I am also minoring in **Computer Science (Intelligence specialization)** and **Earth and Atmosphere Science (Geophysics specialization)**.

My research interests include **Large-scale Scientific Machine Learning, Robotics, Inverse Problems**, Computational Image Processing, Probabilistic Programming, Embedded Coding, and Computational Fluid Simulations. I would love to explore anything that uses computing to solve scientific problem, especially topics related to applied machine learning, artifical intellegence, and any solution to climate change! 

You can find the details of my research experience here: [Research](https://rosenyu304.github.io/research/) (or under the research tab).

Note: I am currently working on 3 research projects with the topics of: Monitoring CO2 Storage with sequential Bayesian inference, Mid-Ocean Ridges Modeling, and Venus Coronae Modeling. -->

**Fun Facts:**
<br>
- I was originally an aerospace engineering major so I know some basics planes/rocketry knowledge. <be> -->

<!-- - I am originally from Taiwan (currently on F1-Visa), and have been studying/traveling in more than 5 countries (US, Switzerland, Israel, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan). <br>

- During my spare time, I spend most of my time running (indoor/cross country) and in-door rock climbing (lead climbing certified @ [Stone Summit](https://www.ssclimbing.com/)).  <br>   -->
